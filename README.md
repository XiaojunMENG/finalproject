## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. In this project I want to design a visualization comparing 40 animations produced by Pixar and Dreamwork from several different perspectives such as Year, rating, domestic and global box office. Moreover, I am hoping to make this visualization vivid by including logos/characters in animations. 

To view this project, ... (embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).

## The data

Description of data...

- Data source
The data come from [Ultimate Movie Ranking](http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/pixar-movies-vs-dreamworks-movies/).
- Data structure - 
The dataset contains 40 Movies, with their year, company, adjusted domestic and global box office, box office rank by year, rating, and oscar nomination/win. The data is organized in a table with each movie occupying a row. 

## Background
Inspired by these example

In all these examples, rating of animations are plotted against year of production. In addition, points are connected by either straight lines/smoothed curves to show tendency. What attracted me most is that the logo/main character of the animation are incorporated into the animation. (Although this makes visualization less scientific, it is more fun to look at!)

Shortcoming of these visualization is that firstly, they only plotted rating against years. Secondly, they are static and I believe that the pictures of logo/main characters and pasted by hand onto the visualization, so making other similar plots would be troublesome(Imagine I want to make other plots of adjusted global and domestic box office vs year for 40 movies, I will have to manually paste 2*40 images!)

## This project
 
### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
